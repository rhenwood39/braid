Braid is an experimental programming language for heterogeneous systems based on multi-stage programming. See [the documentation][docs] for an introduction to the language.

The compiler is written in [TypeScript][] and runs on [Node][].
You can build the compiler and run a few small programs by typing `make test` (if you have [npm][]).
Check out the [code documentation][hacking] for an introduction to the compiler's internals.
